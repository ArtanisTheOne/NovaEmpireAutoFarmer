## Artanis Farmer

This is an old AHK script for Nova Empire, it has **NOT** been updated to conform to the later versions of the game. If you are interested in the latest version you will have to understand and learn AHK yourself and modify this script.

I'm providing this script as a base, it took me a long time to finish and seems a waste to simply delete.

#### The optimizations this script makes compared to others out there are:
- **3D mode is used instead of 2D**
    - This is the script's main novel feature, using 3D mode allows the script to track where fleets are in the system, allowing for the closest fleet to be chosen to attack a pirate.
- **Fleets are kept track of**


This can be used as a base to integrate into a farmer which does repairs or just be fixed up to work with the latest version of the game.

Please note, the images in the `./images` folder may need to be re-taken on your machine.

> **IMPORTANT**: THIS SCRIPT IS ONLY GUARANTEED TO WORK WITH THE STEAM VERSION OF NOVA EMPIRE. FURTHERMORE, COORDS ARE HARDCODED FOR A 4K RES SCREEN [changes required to dynamically change based on screen size]
> **This script is provided as-is, if you wish, contact me on discord (art4nis) for any development questions.**
